The project PrepConnect is a social networking platform built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). It offers features such as anonymous chat, personal messaging, a question-and-answer forum, and interactive quizzes.

Project Structure:

- **Client**: The frontend of the application built with React.
  - Entry Point: 

main.jsx

 renders the root React component.
  - App Component: 

App.jsx

 defines the main application routes using React Router.
  - Pages:
    - Home: 

Home.jsx

 and `Home.css` provide the landing page with introduction and features.
    - Dashboard: 

Dashboard.jsx

 displays user-specific information after authentication.
    - Authentication:
      - Login: 

Login.jsx

 allows users to log in.
      - Register: 

Register.jsx

 enables new user registration.
    - Chat:
      - Anonymous Chat: 

AnonymousChat.jsx

 for anonymous group conversations.
      - Personal Chat: 

PersonalChat.jsx

 for direct messaging between users.
    - Question Forum:
      - Question List: `QuestionListPage.jsx` displays a list of posted questions.
      - Question Detail: `QuestionPage.jsx` shows details of a single question, answers, and explanations.
      - Add Question: `AddQuestionPage.jsx` allows users to submit new questions.
    - Quiz: `QuizPage.jsx` presents interactive quizzes to the user.
  - Components:
    - NavBar: 

NavBar.jsx

 provides navigation links across the application.

- **Server**: The backend of the application built with Express.js.
  - Server Entry Point: 

server.js

 handles API endpoints, database connections, and Socket.io setup.
  - API Routes:
    - Authentication:
      - Register: `POST /api/register` registers a new user.
      - Login: `POST /api/login` authenticates existing users.
    - User Dashboard:
      - Dashboard Data: `GET /api/dashboard` provides user-specific data.
    - Questions and Answers:
      - Get Questions: `GET /api/questions` retrieves all questions.
      - Get Single Question: `GET /api/questions/:id` fetches a specific question by ID.
      - Add Question: `POST /api/questions` allows authenticated users to post new questions.
      - Explain Question: `POST /api/explain/:id` generates explanations for questions using an AI API.
    - Comments:
      - Add Comment: `POST /api/comments` adds a comment to a question.
      - Get Comments: `GET /api/comments/:questionId` retrieves comments for a specific question.
    - Users:
      - Get Users: `GET /api/users` provides a list of users for personal chat.
  - Real-Time Communication:
    - Socket.io: Integrated in 

server.js

 to handle real-time messaging for both anonymous and personal chats.
  - Database Connection:
    - MongoDB: Uses the MongoDB Node.js driver to connect to the database and perform CRUD operations.

Module Explanations:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Register and Login: Users can create accounts and log in via forms in `Register.jsx` and `Login.jsx`.
   - JWT Tokens: The server generates JWT tokens upon successful authentication, managed in 

server.js

.
   - Protected Routes: Components like `Dashboard.jsx` check for valid tokens before rendering content.

2. **Dashboard**:
   - Displays personalized greetings and options.
   - Fetches data from the server using the `/api/dashboard` endpoint.
   - Redirects unauthorized users to the login page.

3. **Anonymous Chat**:
   - Allows users to chat without revealing their identity.
   - Implemented in `AnonymousChat.jsx`.
   - Utilizes Socket.io for real-time messaging.

4. **Personal Chat**:
   - Enables direct messaging between registered users.
   - `PersonalChat.jsx` fetches the list of users and manages one-on-one chats.
   - Also uses Socket.io for instant communication.

5. **Question and Answer Forum**:
   - Question List: Users can view all questions in `QuestionListPage.jsx`.
   - Question Details: `QuestionPage.jsx` shows a question's content, available answers, and allows users to request explanations.
   - Add Questions: Authenticated users can post new questions using `AddQuestionPage.jsx`.

6. **Quizzes**:
   - `QuizPage.jsx` presents a series of quiz questions fetched from the server.
   - Users select answers, and upon submission, their score is calculated and displayed.

7. **Home Page**:
   - The landing page created in `Home.jsx` introduces the platform's features.
   - Includes interactive elements and links to explore different sections.
   - Styled with `Home.css`.

8. **Navigation Bar**:
   - The `NavBar` component provides consistent navigation across pages.
   - Links to Home, Questions, Quiz, Chat features, and handles user authentication status (e.g., showing 'Sign Out' when the user is logged in).

9. **Server-Side API and Logic**:
   - Express Server: 

server.js

 sets up the API endpoints and middleware.
   - Database Operations: Interacts with MongoDB collections for users, questions, comments, and chats.
   - Authentication Middleware: Validates JWT tokens for protected routes.
   - Explanation Generation: Uses an AI API to generate explanations for questions when requested by users.

10. **Environment Configuration**:
    - Environment variables are stored in `.env` files as noted in 

start.txt

.
    - Variables include `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, and others necessary for server operation.

Key Technologies Used:

- Frontend:
  - React.js for building user interfaces.
  - React Router DOM for client-side routing.
  - Socket.io-client for real-time communication.
- Backend:
  - Node.js with Express.js for building the server.
  - MongoDB for data storage.
  - Socket.io for WebSocket communication.
  - JWT for authentication.
  - Axios for making API requests, including to external AI APIs.

How Modules Interact:

- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls and WebSocket connections.
- Authentication tokens are stored in local storage on the client and sent with requests to protected endpoints.
- Real-time features like chat use Socket.io to establish persistent connections between the client and server.
- The server accesses the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data for users, messages, questions, and comments.

Deployment and Scripts:

- Running the Server:
  - Navigate to the 

server

 directory and run `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode.
- Running the Client:
  - Navigate to the 

client

 directory and run `npm run dev` to start the React application.
- Build Scripts:
  - The client can be built for production using `npm run build`.

Configuration Files:

- Package.json:
  - 

package.json

 and 

package.json

 list dependencies and scripts.
- Vite Config:
  - `vite.config.js` configures the Vite development server for the React app.
