      - Add Question: `POST /api/questions` allows authenticated users to post new questions.
      - Explain Question: `POST /api/explain/:id` generates explanations for questions using an AI API.
    - Comments:
      - Add Comment: `POST /api/comments` adds a comment to a question.
      - Get Comments: `GET /api/comments/:questionId` retrieves comments for a specific question.
    - Users:
      - Get Users: `GET /api/users` provides a list of users for personal chat.
  - Real-Time Communication:
    - Socket.io: Integrated in 

server.js

 to handle real-time messaging for both anonymous and personal chats.
  - Database Connection:
    - MongoDB: Uses the MongoDB Node.js driver to connect to the database and perform CRUD operations.

Module Explanations:

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Register and Login: Users can create accounts and log in via forms in `Register.jsx` and `Login.jsx`.
   - JWT Tokens: The server generates JWT tokens upon successful authentication, managed in 

server.js

.
   - Protected Routes: Components like `Dashboard.jsx` check for valid tokens before rendering content.

2. **Dashboard**:
   - Displays personalized greetings and options.
   - Fetches data from the server using the `/api/dashboard` endpoint.
   - Redirects unauthorized users to the login page.

3. **Anonymous Chat**:
   - Allows users to chat without revealing their identity.
   - Implemented in `AnonymousChat.jsx`.
   - Utilizes Socket.io for real-time messaging.

4. **Personal Chat**:
   - Enables direct messaging between registered users.
   - `PersonalChat.jsx` fetches the list of users and manages one-on-one chats.
   - Also uses Socket.io for instant communication.

5. **Question and Answer Forum**:
   - Question List: Users can view all questions in `QuestionListPage.jsx`.
   - Question Details: `QuestionPage.jsx` shows a question's content, available answers, and allows users to request explanations.
   - Add Questions: Authenticated users can post new questions using `AddQuestionPage.jsx`.

6. **Quizzes**:
   - `QuizPage.jsx` presents a series of quiz questions fetched from the server.
   - Users select answers, and upon submission, their score is calculated and displayed.

7. **Home Page**:
   - The landing page created in `Home.jsx` introduces the platform's features.
   - Includes interactive elements and links to explore different sections.
   - Styled with `Home.css`.

8. **Navigation Bar**:
   - The `NavBar` component provides consistent navigation across pages.
   - Links to Home, Questions, Quiz, Chat features, and handles user authentication status (e.g., showing 'Sign Out' when the user is logged in).

9. **Server-Side API and Logic**:
   - Express Server: 

server.js

 sets up the API endpoints and middleware.
   - Database Operations: Interacts with MongoDB collections for users, questions, comments, and chats.
   - Authentication Middleware: Validates JWT tokens for protected routes.
   - Explanation Generation: Uses an AI API to generate explanations for questions when requested by users.

10. **Environment Configuration**:
    - Environment variables are stored in `.env` files as noted in 

start.txt

.
    - Variables include `MONGO_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `PORT`, and others necessary for server operation.

Key Technologies Used:

- Frontend:
  - React.js for building user interfaces.
  - React Router DOM for client-side routing.
  - Socket.io-client for real-time communication.
- Backend:
  - Node.js with Express.js for building the server.
  - MongoDB for data storage.
  - Socket.io for WebSocket communication.
  - JWT for authentication.
  - Axios for making API requests, including to external AI APIs.

How Modules Interact:

- The frontend communicates with the backend via RESTful API calls and WebSocket connections.
- Authentication tokens are stored in local storage on the client and sent with requests to protected endpoints.
- Real-time features like chat use Socket.io to establish persistent connections between the client and server.
- The server accesses the MongoDB database to store and retrieve data for users, messages, questions, and comments.

Deployment and Scripts:

- Running the Server:
  - Navigate to the 

server

 directory and run `npm run dev` to start the server in development mode.
- Running the Client:
  - Navigate to the 

client

 directory and run `npm run dev` to start the React application.
- Build Scripts:
  - The client can be built for production using `npm run build`.

Configuration Files:

- Package.json:
  - 

package.json

 and 

package.json

 list dependencies and scripts.
- Vite Config:
  - `vite.config.js` configures the Vite development server for the React app.

This overview explains the structure and functionality of each module in the PrepConnect project, detailing how components and files interact to provide a comprehensive social networking platform.



The OTP generation and verification process in your code has a few potential vulnerabilities that could be abused:

1. **Rate Limiting**: There is no rate limiting on the OTP generation endpoint, which means an attacker could flood the endpoint with requests, potentially causing a denial of service or exhausting resources.
2. **OTP Reuse**: The same OTP can be reused multiple times if not properly invalidated after use.
3. **Weak OTP Generation**: The OTP generation logic uses a simple random number generator, which might not be secure enough.
4. **Lack of IP Throttling**: There is no IP-based throttling to prevent abuse from a single IP address.

To fix these issues, you can implement the following improvements:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Use a rate-limiting middleware to limit the number of requests to the OTP generation endpoint.
2. **Invalidate OTP After Use**: Ensure that OTPs are invalidated after they are used.
3. **Secure OTP Generation**: Use a more secure method for generating OTPs.
4. **IP Throttling**: Implement IP-based throttling to prevent abuse from a single IP address.

Here is an example of how you can implement these improvements:

### 1. Rate Limiting

Install the 

express-rate-limit

 package:

```sh
npm install express-rate-limit
```

Add rate limiting to your OTP generation endpoint:

```js
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

const otpRateLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many OTP requests from this IP, please try again after 15 minutes"
});

app.post("/api/generate-otp", otpRateLimiter, async (req, res) => {
  // Your existing OTP generation logic
});
```

### 2. Invalidate OTP After Use

Ensure that OTPs are invalidated after they are used:

```js
app.post("/api/reset-password", async (req, res) => {
  const { email, otp, newPassword } = req.body;
  const usersCollection = db.collection("users");
  const otpsCollection = db.collection("otps");

  const otpDoc = await otpsCollection.findOne({ email: email.toLowerCase(), otp });
  if (!otpDoc) {
    return res.json({ status: "error", error: "Invalid OTP" });
  }

  // Invalidate the OTP
  await otpsCollection.deleteOne({ _id: otpDoc._id });

  const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(newPassword, 10);
  await usersCollection.updateOne({ email: email.toLowerCase() }, { $set: { password: hashedPassword } });
  res.json({ status: "ok", message: "Password reset successful" });
});
```

### 3. Secure OTP Generation

Use a more secure method for generating OTPs:

```js
function generateSecureOtp() {
  return crypto.randomBytes(3).toString('hex'); // Generates a 6-character hex string
}

app.post("/api/generate-otp", async (req, res) => {
  const { email, name } = req.body;
  const usersCollection = db.collection("users");
  const otpsCollection = db.collection("otps");

  const existingUserByEmail = await usersCollection.findOne({ email: email.toLowerCase() });
  if (existingUserByEmail) {
    return res.json({ status: "error", error: "User with this email already exists" });
  }

  const otp = generateSecureOtp();
  await otpsCollection.insertOne({ email: email.toLowerCase(), otp });

  await sendOtpEmail(email, otp);
  res.json({ status: "ok", message: "OTP sent to email" });
});
```

### 4. IP Throttling

Implement IP-based throttling to prevent abuse from a single IP address:

```js
import slowDown from 'express-slow-down';

const otpSpeedLimiter = slowDown({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  delayAfter: 5, // Allow 5 requests per 15 minutes, then delay
  delayMs: 500 // Begin adding 500ms of delay per request above 5
});

app.post("/api/generate-otp", otpSpeedLimiter, async (req, res) => {
  // Your existing OTP generation logic
});
```

By implementing these improvements, you can help prevent abuse of the OTP generation and verification process in your application.
