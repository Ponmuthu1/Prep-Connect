//You switch back and forth between branches using 
git checkout <branch name>.

//And yes, 
git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME 
//is the correct way to create a new branch and switching to it. At the same time, the command you used is a shorthand to git branch <branch name> and git checkout <branch name>.


//git init 
//git remote add origin https://github.com/Ponmuthu1/Prep-Connect

git add .
git commit -m "Commit message"
git push -u -f origin <branchname>
